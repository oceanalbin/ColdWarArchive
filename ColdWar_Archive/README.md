### General Research
My original artefact was a 'Kienspel' (Dutch for a boardgame, similar to Bingo), from the International Organisation of Good Templars, whose international body is known as Movendi International, is a fraternal organization which is part of the temperance movement, promoting abstinence from alcohol and other drugs. While I was getting more information on the IOGT I found out that they used this boardgame to gain extra cash income for their organisation and also used as an tool to gather and force their followers to meet more often, since it is a gambling game, people are more likely to come more often to play. While I was looking at the history of games I found interesting articles about how a lot of governments use games as propaganda and as a tool for recruitment. I figured I was not so interested in the actual movement of IOGT, but rather their use a of a game as a tool for propaganda, so I continued my research and found articles about how the Soviet Union, under Stalin's power used socialist realism, a particular form of propaganda disguised as art that glorified the Soviet state and party, its workers, and depicted scenes from everyday life.

Now I was getting excited, I learned a lot of historical facts which I either had forgotten or never learned, but my research did not end here, because again I found a new entry point, which has a lot of propaganda and power struggles, because I wanted my video game to have a more global view, a good topic to show propaganda from 'both' sides of the world: The Cold War. I focussed my research on the first part of the Cold War; on the NATO and Warsaw Pact, the Space Race and the Arms Race.

<summary>What is Bingo?</summary>
<br>
  A game which dates back to 1530 in Italy, the standardised version dates back to 1920's America.

  In the United States, Bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on cards which the numbers the game host (caller) draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card, which prompts the game host (or an associate assisting the host) to examine the card for verification of the win. Players compete against one another to be the first to have a winning arrangement for the prize or jackpot. After a winner is declared, the players clear their number cards of the tiles and the game host begins a new round of play.

  [Bingo (American version)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version))

  > Bingo is often used as an instructional tool in American schools and in teaching English as a foreign language in many countries. Typically, the numbers are replaced with beginning reader words, pictures, or unsolved math problems. Custom bingo creation programs now allow teachers and parents to create bingo cards using their own content.


  <img src="https://github.com/oceanalbin/ColdWarArchive/blob/master/ColdWar_Archive/Documentation/img/Screen_Shot_2020-03-02_at_11.40.33.png" width="25%">
  <br>  Bingo as a teaching tool.

  > In the US, the game is primarily staged by churches or charity organizations. Their legality and stakes vary by state regulation. In some states, bingo halls are rented out to sponsoring organizations, and such halls often run games almost every day. Church-run games, however, are normally weekly affairs held on the church premises. These games are usually played for modest stakes, although the final game of a session is frequently a coverall game that offers a larger jackpot prize for winning within a certain quantity of numbers called, and a progressive jackpot is one that may increase per session until it is won.

  Connection to International Organisation of Good Templars, which can be compared to a church or charity organisation, they could use it to get some extra income for the organisation.

  > Bingo has gone beyond a fundraising role and is often featured in bars and nightclubs as a social and entertainment event, attracting a loyal following of regular players. Many venues promote a bingo event to attract customers at off-peak times, such as weeknights and Sundays, which are traditionally slower for such businesses. The games are called by drag and non-drag hosts alike and often include ancillary activities such as cabaret shows, contests and other themed activities that add interest and encourage audience participation. Customers are invited to play for a chance to win cash and other prizes.

  Therefor this game can organise a sense of unity and community between followers of the IOoGT. A method of bonding.

  ## Kienspel(Dutch)

  My own view on Bingo: in Dutch culture it is mainly used as a game to socialise and entertain elderly people, you often see Bingo nights in care houses.

  ## What is the purpose of this game and why would the "International Organisation of Good Templars" make use of it?

  There are multiple purposes of Bingo, but my guess at the purpose of Bingo within the IOoGT is to create a cash flow income to help them spread their message in a better way. Also to create a community, a reason to get together to form a group, so a method of bonding between ints followers.

Epic Games (an American video game and software developer and publisher) made a statement they do not want to convey political messages... and even banning players who try to.
> Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney gave the keynote speech at this week’s DICE conference in Las Vegas. The talk touched on many topics, including data privacy, loot boxes, and the problems with a lack of cross-platform games. *It also seemed to call for keeping politics out of games, or at least out of marketing, or something.*

Games as a tool for recruiting for the army and spreading negative message about other nationalities.

> America’s Army was released by the US Army on 4 July 2002 and, up until now, 41 versions of the game have been released in total, all financed by the US government and available for free download. The game is a recruitment tool, and each version has two parts: Operations, in which the player battles opponents in a first-person shooter mode, and Soldiers, in which the player advances up the various ranks.

Multiple games with political statements.
Game examples: Call of Duty("terrorists", of multiple etniticities), Wolfenstein(nazis) uses a lot of propaganda.

- Streamers

    Some streamers have huge fanbases, whom watch their livestreams, most streamers try not to be political, but this platform could be a perfect way to distribute propaganda.
    Streamers I sometimes check out, they have a big followers base. They have a chatbox where all the people who follow their stream can chat together, this is most of the times a big stream of messages.

*What forms of propaganda did Stalin use?*

Soviet **propaganda** under **Stalin** was dominated by socialist realism, a particular **form of propaganda** disguised as art that glorified the Soviet state and party, its workers, and depicted scenes from everyday life.

Statues of Stalin were also a big part of Stalins propaganda.

<summary>The Cold War</summary>
<br>
The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II. The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. The term "cold" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) discouraged a pre-emptive attack by either side. Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race.<br><br>

*So I have a good amount of entry points to make transcodings about: Western vs Eastern block, proxy wars, temporary alliance, Nuclear Arms Race(Coding direction), Military deployment, struggle of dominance, psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage and Space Race, to name a few.*

</details>


# Transcoding
I started my transcoding with a mindmap regarding the tensions between the Eastern and Western fronts. My transcoding process was a bit unusual, I started from a Bingo artefact from the International Organisation of Good Templars, in this bingo game I found out that the IOGT used this bingo game as a leverage on their followers giving them an extra cash income + more gatherings of their followers. Unfortunately the object itself was not worth transcoding/basing my whole project on. From this point on I had quite a intensive research in the manifestation of propaganda in video games, which I was deeply interested in. After this I deepened my research into propaganda and arrived at propaganda during wartime and eventually the Cold War, which sprouted with propaganda. Now to start looking for a whole new artefact and topic would be a pity... I had the topic and idea to make a game about the Cold War, so I started looking for artefacts regarding the Cold War.

## Transcoding No. 1
### Mindmap
First transcoding, to get the ball rolling. A mindmap about America's current state of affairs in the gaming branch with ties to propaganda. This is from my research about propaganda in videogames, focussed on Americas military recruitment tools.

### Modelling
Second transcoding, a low poly rocket, which resembles a rocket from the arms race between the Western and Eastern front of the Cold War.

## Transcoding No. 3
### Sculpting
Third transcoding, digital sculpts made in Oculus Medium, with a Oculus VR headset. The sculpts are interpretations of my 5 artefacts I chose from the archive.

### Tools
The tools that I have used for this projects are TextEdit programs, to format and write HTML, CSS and JS. For the transcodings I used photoshop, to make sketches. I used Blender and Oculus Medium to model and texture props for my videogame.
To make a videogame I used Unity for the visual creating and Visual Studio to code and format my C#.

## Transcoding Tool
### Unity and Visual Studio
My original idea was to use Blender as my transcoding tool, quite soon already I ditched Blender for the Oculus Medium to make 3D sculpted models for my game, while texturing done in Cinema4d. Unity was used to compile all the models together and make a environment to, Visual Studio was used to code all the actions in the game.

### Aims
The tool is made for getting a better understanding of artefacts from the Cold war in the IISG, combing them into one world. To create a new story, one where you, the player can find all the hidden Propaganda and Anti Propaganda.

### Methods
C# — HTML — CSS — JS

### Results
My result is combining my transcoded models into a video game about the Cold War.

# Reflection
During this process I focussed a lot on the research and conceptual part of this project instead of focussing purely on the visual side, which is my 'normal' way of working, therefor I challenged myself and ran into problems which I have not encountered so far in my studies, at times those could be quite annoying, but also motivating.

# Outcome
The outcome of this transcoding and toolmaking assignment is a game made in Unity, formatted with C#, filled with artefacts from the IISG library regarding the topics of the Cold War. This game will take you through encounters to gain additional insights and make new connections, which are not shown in the metadata in the collections from the IISG.

# Conclusion
During this project I learned how to work with a rather hard to research archive, from the IISG. Learned new software; Blender, to make models of the artefacts. Unity, combined with Visual Studio to make a video game. I found out that making a proper functioning video game is quite a tedious and time consuming thing, but also a rewarding experience.
